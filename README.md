# Sarasota Market Pulse ("Market Strategist")

**A serverless ETL pipeline designed to ingest structured real estate data from Zillow and Redfin, normalize it against county property appraiser records, and compute market-level intelligence (Price Pressure, Inventory Absorption, Cash Flow Zones) for institutional-grade decision support. Deployed via GitHub Actions for automated weekly execution.**

## 🎯 Overview

The **Sarasota Market Pulse** automatically monitors the Sarasota, FL market and delivers weekly intelligence reports. Using **market-level strategist analytics**, providing a macro view of inventory, rent yields, and pricing power.

- **Zillow Research**: Ingests ZHVI (Home Values) and ZORI (Observed Rents) by zip code.
- **Redfin Data Center**: Tracks weeks of supply, sale-to-list ratios, and absorption rates.
- **County Property Appraiser**: Cross-references public records for flip detection and appraisal gaps.
- **Zero-Cost Infrastructure**: Runs entirely on GitHub Actions using JSON-based persistence.

## 📊 Market Strategist Metrics

**5 sophisticated indicator sets**:

### 1. 📉 Price Pressure Index
**Source:** Redfin  
**Signals:** Median sale price + average sale-to-list ratio. Identifies if sellers are losing control (ratio < 1.0) or if bidding wars are prevalent.

### 2. 📦 Inventory & Absorption
**Source:** Redfin  
**Signals:** Weeks of supply + New Listings vs. Homes Sold ratio. Flags "Buyer's Markets" when supply exceeds 18 weeks.

### 3. 💰 Cash Flow Zone Finder
**Source:** Zillow  
**Signals:** Rent-to-Value ratio (ZORI ÷ ZHVI) ranked by zip code. Identifies which Sarasota neighborhoods offer the highest gross yields for investors.

### 4. 🔄 Short Hold Flip Detector
**Source:** County Records  
**Signals:** Identifies properties purchased 4-12 months ago and re-sold. Tracks renovation markups across the county.

### 5. 📊 Appraisal vs. Market Gap
**Source:** Zillow + County  
**Signals:** Divergence between Zillow market values and county JUST (appraised) values. High gaps (15%+) signal a "hot" market running ahead of tax assessments.

### State Management (Project Memory)

The pipeline uses **JSON-based history** stored in `data/history/`. 
- **Persistence:** Snapshots are committed back to the repo weekly.
- **Intelligence:** Enables calculation of Week-over-Week (WoW) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.
- **Resilience:** Automatic cleanup of history older than 4 weeks.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

### Local Setup

1. **Clone & Install:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Manual Redfin Ingestion (Optional):**
   If automation is bypassed, drop Redfin exports directly into `data/redfin/`. The pipeline will detect and standardize them automatically.

3. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export GMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
   export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
   export EMAIL_TO="recipient@example.com"
   ```

4. **Run:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
